            <h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
            <p>Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. In particular, if you have a disability/health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach your instructor, course coordinator, and/or the <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/ability/">AccessAbility Services Office</a> as soon as possible. I will work with you and AccessAbility Services to ensure you can achieve your learning goals in this course. Enquiries are confidential.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Diversity Statement</h3>
            <p>Diversity is central to who we are and what we do at the University of Toronto Scarborough. We believe it is vital to foster diversity in all facets of our campus culture. In this course, it is the responsibility of each and every one of us — the instructors, the teaching assistants, and, most importantly, the students — to provide a welcoming and supportive environment for all. If you have a concern, please feel free to approach your instructor/course coordinator, or the <a href="https://edio.utsc.utoronto.ca/">UTSC Equity & Diversity Office</a> as soon as possible. Enquiries are confidential.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
            <p>All of the work you submit must be done by you, and your work must not be submitted by someone else. Plagiarism is academic fraud and is taken very seriously. The department uses software that compares programs for evidence of similar code. Please read the Rules and Regulations from the U of T Governing Council, especially the <a href="https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-behaviour-academic-matters-july-1-2019">Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters</a>.</p>
            <p>Please also see the information for students from the <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/aacc/academic-integrity">Office of Student Academic Integrity</a>.</p>
            <p>Please don't copy. We want you to succeed and are here to help.</p>
            <p>The simplest advice for avoiding plagiarism is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Never look at another student’s assignment solution (except for your teammates, if collaboration is allowed). This includes solutions on paper, computer screens, or any other medium. Similarly, never show your assignment solution to another student. This rule applies to all stages of your work, including drafts and incomplete solutions.</li>
                <li>If you find code on the web that solves part or all of an assignment, do not use or submit any part of it. A large percentage of the academic offences in CS involve students who have never met, and who just happened to find the same solution online. If you find a solution, someone else will too.</li>
                <li><b>Be very careful</b> when engaging "tutoring services". In previous years, we had students suspended from the university as a result of submitting work that was done with the "help" of such "tutors". When in doubt whether a tutoring company is offering real teaching or is helping students cheat, do not hesitate to ask your instructor — we are here to help!</li>
